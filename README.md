## Problem Statement
**HC-01**

Essential medicines such as insulin and thyroid medications frequently go out of stock without prior warning, especially at the district level. This leads to public panic, price gouging, and black-market hoarding, with no centralized mechanism to detect or act on such shortages in real time.
To build a real-time monitoring platform that detects medicine shortages and price anomalies using crowdsourced data from patients and inventory updates from pharmacies. The system will alert health authorities and NGOs to act on emerging trends before they escalate.
